Welcome to Democrify.me!
Democrify is a Web app that spices up traditional party playlists with some democracy. 
Democrify is your 21st century jukebox: you can create a party Spotify playlist, share it with your guests and let them line-up the songs that match the vibe perfectly.
So what are you waiting for? Let's party! 🎉

## Features

### Playlist management and sharing
Browse your existing playlists, create new ones, add/remove songs. Share your playlist with your friends using a generated code. 🙏

### Contribute to your friends playlists
Do you think you think that Despacito sounds like a great match for the party vibe? Join your friend's shared playlist using a code and add/remove the songs to the party playlist. 🥳

### In-app player
