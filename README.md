Welcome to Democrify.me!
Democrify is a Web app that spices up traditional party playlists with some democracy. 
Democrify is your 21st century jukebox: you can create a party Spotify playlist, share it with your guests and let them line-up the songs that match the vibe perfectly.
So what are you waiting for? Let's party! 🎉

# Features

### Playlist management and sharing
Browse your existing playlists, create new ones, add/remove songs. Share your playlist with your friends using a generated code. 🙏

### Contribute to your friends playlists
Do you think you that Despacito sounds like a great match for the party? Join your friend's shared playlist using a code and add/remove the songs to the party playlist. 🥳

### In-app player
Skip the desktop app altogether and play any songs using a built-in player. 🎶

### Mobile-friendly
Democrify can be used on your desktop as well as your mobile. Who brings desktops to parties anyways? 🤔

### Live Mode (future feature)
Switch your playlist live and let your guests to vote for the next song. Or skip the current one, if they think it's horrible. Party democracy in its best.   
This feature has proven to be quite complex to implement, but it is our next priority in implementation of this awesome project. You can find our vision of Live Mode [here](https://github.com/Sapphire-Snail/Democrify/wiki/Live-mode)
